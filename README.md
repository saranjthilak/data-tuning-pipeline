# Data Tuning Pipeline

This repository contains a modular pipeline for preprocessing, tuning, and validating structured data for machine learning workflows. It focuses on creating a scalable, reproducible system for data cleaning, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.

## 🚀 Features

- End-to-end pipeline from raw data to tuned model
- Data cleaning and transformation logic
- Feature engineering scripts
- Model tuning with cross-validation
- Configurable architecture for experimentation
